System/161 MIPS Processor
</font></h2>

<p>
The 32-bit MIPS is the simplest "real" 32-bit processor for which
development tools are readily available; furthermore, the MIPS
architecture is already widely used for teaching in various contexts.
This makes it a natural choice for System/161.
</p>

<p>
The specific dialect of MIPS processor found in System/161, which for
a lack of a better term we'll refer to as MIPS-161, is essentially a
cache-coherent r3000, or MIPS-I.
</p>

<h3><font face=tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans>User Mode</font></h3>
<p>
In user mode, the MIPS-161 behaves the same as any other 32-bit MIPS.
All user instructions are fully interlocked and there are no pipeline
hazards. All MIPS-I instructions are supported. MIPS-II and higher
instructions are not supported, except for the <tt>ll</tt> and
<tt>sc</tt> instructions used for multiprocessor synchronization.
Please consult your favorite MIPS reference for further details.
</p>

<h3><font face=tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans>Kernel Mode</font></h3>
<p>
In kernel mode, the MIPS-161 is mostly a MIPS-I, with a few
differences and a few extensions borrowed from later MIPS versions.
For completeness, the following sections define the complete kernel
mode interface.
</p>

<h3><font face=tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans>Kernel Instructions</font></h3>
<p>
The <tt>WAIT</tt> instruction has been borrowed from MIPS-II. This
operation puts the processor into a low-power state and suspends
execution until some external event occurs, such as an interrupt.
Since the exact behavior of <tt>WAIT</tt> is not clearly specified
anywhere I could find, the MIPS-161 behavior is as follows:
<ul>
<li> <tt>WAIT</tt> should be executed with interrupts disabled or
     masked in the processor.
<li> <tt>WAIT</tt> will complete when any of the processor interrupt
     pins are activated.
<li> The interrupt is not serviced until it is unmasked or
     re-enabled.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Regarding the <tt>TLBR</tt>, <tt>TLBWR</tt>, <tt>TLBWI</tt>, and
<tt>TLBP</tt> instructions, see the MMU section below. Regarding the
<tt>RFE</tt> instruction, see the trap handling section, also below.
Regarding the <tt>MFC0</tt> and <tt>MTC0</tt> instructions, see the
next section.
</p>


<h3><font face=tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans>Kernel Registers</font></h3>

<p>
The MIPS-161 has 10 supervisor registers in coprocessor 0. These may
be accessed with the <tt>MFC0</tt> (move from coprocessor 0) and
<tt>MTC0</tt> instruction, as follows:
<pre>
	mfc0 $4, $12
</pre>
loads the contents of supervisor register 12 (STATUS) into
general-purpose register 4 (a0), and
<pre>
	mtc0 $4, $12
</pre>
does the reverse.
</p>

<p>
The supervisor registers are:
<ul>
<li> INDEX ($0)
<li> RANDOM ($1)
<li> TLBLO ($2)
<li> CONTEXT ($4)
<li> BADVADDR ($8)
<li> TLBHI ($10)
<li> STATUS ($12)
<li> CAUSE ($13)
<li> EPC ($14)
<li> PRID ($15)
</ul>

<h3><font face=tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans>Trap Handling</font></h3>

<p>
When an exception occurs, the following things happen:
<nl>
<li> The PC where the exception occurred is loaded into the EPC
register.
<li> If this was in a branch delay slot, the EPC register is set to
the address of the branch (that is, 4 is subtracted) and the BD flag
in the CAUSE register is set. Software need not examine the BD flag
unless the exact address of the faulting instruction is wanted,
e.g. for disassembly and analysis.
<li> The EXC field of the CAUSE register is set to reflect what
happened. The exception codes are listed below.
<li> For coprocessor-related exceptions the CE field of the CAUSE
register is set.
<li> For interrupts the H and F bits of the CAUSE register are set to
reflect the interrupt(s) that are active.
<li> For MMU exceptions the BADVADDR register is loaded with the failing
address. A masked and shifted form suitable for indexing a page table
is placed in the VSHIFT field of the CONTEXT register.
<li> The bottom six bits of the STATUS register are shifted left by
two. The "o" (old) bits are lost; the "p" (previous) bits become the
old bits; the "c" (current) bits become the previous bits; and the
current bits are set to 0. This disables interrupts and puts the
processor in kernel mode.
<li> Execution continues from one of five hardwired addresses
according to what happened and the setting of the B (boot) bit in the
STATUS register.
</p>

<p>
The exception handler addresses are:
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=5%>&nbsp;</td><td>
<table width=100%>
<tr><th align=left>B</th><th align=left>Trap</th>
                         <th align=left>Address</th></tr>
<tr><td>1</td> <td>General</td> <td>0xbfc0 0180</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td> <td>UTLB</td>    <td>0xbfc0 0100</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td> <td>Reset</td>   <td>0xbfc0 0000</td></tr>
<tr><td>0</td> <td>General</td> <td>0x8000 0080</td></tr>
<tr><td>0</td> <td>UTLB</td>    <td>0x8000 0000</td></tr>
</table>
</td><td width=5%></tr>
</table>
A UTLB exception is a TLB miss that occurs against the user address
space (0x0000 0000 - 0x7fff ffff) and occurs because no matching TLB
entry was found. Other TLB exceptions go through the General vector.
This allows a fast-path TLB refill handler. See below.
</p>

<p>
To return from an exception, one executes the following sequence:
<pre>
	jr k0
	rfe
</pre>
where the k0 register has been loaded with the desired exception
return address, either the value previously retrieved from the EPC
register or some other address chosen by software. The RFE instruction
is not a jump; it occurs in the delay slot of a jump. It shifts the
six bottom bits of the status register right by two, undoing the shift
done at exception entry time. This returns the processor to whatever
interrupt state and mode (user/kernel) it was in when the exception
occurred.
</p>

<p>
Because there are three pairs of state bits, the processor can take
two nested exceptions without losing state, if one is careful. This is
to facilitate the fast-path TLB refill handler. See below.
</p>

<p>
The two soft interrupt lines can be activated by writing to the CAUSE
register.
</p>

<p>
The exception codes:
<ul>
<li> IRQ (0) -- Interrupt
<li> MOD (1) -- "Modify", TLB read-only fault
<li> TLBL (2) -- TLB miss on load
<li> TLBS (3) -- TLB miss on store
<li> ADEL (4) -- Address error on load
<li> ADES (5) -- Address error on store
<li> IBE (6) -- Bus error on instruction fetch
<li> DBE (7) -- Bus error on data access
<li> SYS (8) -- System call
<li> BP (9) -- Breakpoint instruction
<li> RI (10) -- Reserved (illegal) instruction
<li> CPU (11) -- Coprocessor unusable
<li> OVF (12) -- Integer overflow
<li> 13-15 -- Reserved
</ul>
The IBE and DBE exceptions are not MMU exceptions and do not set
BADVADDR.
</p>

<h3><font face=tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans>MMU</font></h3>
<p>
The MMU is the MIPS-I MMU, with a 64-entry fully associative TLB where
each entry maps one 4K virtual page to one 4K physical page. The
paired pages setup of later MIPS processors is not present, and there
is no support for superpages.
</p>

<p>
The processor's virtual address space is divided into four segments:
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=5%>&nbsp;</td><td>
<table width=100%>
<tr><th width=15% align=left>Name</th><th align=left>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>kseg2</td><td>Supervisor mode only; TLB-mapped, cacheable</td></tr>
<tr><td>kseg1</td><td>Supervisor mode only; direct-mapped, uncached</td></tr>
<tr><td>kseg0</td><td>Supervisor mode only; direct-mapped, cached</td></tr>
<tr><td>kuseg</td><td>User and supervisor mode; TLB-mapped, cacheable</td></tr>
</table>
</td><td width=5%>&nbsp;</td></tr>
</table>
The mapped segments are mapped via a translation lookaside buffer
(TLB) with software refill. The direct-mapped segments are mapped
(without use of the TLB) both to the first 512 megabytes of the 
physical memory space.
Typically the kernel lives in kseg0, hardware devices are accessed
through kseg1, and user-mode programs are run in kuseg.
</p>

<p>
There are four MMU-related instructions:
<ul>
<li> <tt>TLBR</tt> uses the SLOT field of the INDEX register to choose
a TLB entry, and reads it into the TLBLO and TLBHI registers.
<li> <tt>TLBWI</tt> uses the SLOT field of the INDEX register to choose
a TLB entry, and writes the TLBLO and TLBHI registers into it.
<li> <tt>TLBWR</tt> uses the SLOT field of the RANDOM register to choose
a TLB entry, and writes the TLBLO and TLBHI registers into it.
<li> <tt>TLBP</tt> searches the TLB for an entry matching the TLBHI
register, and sets the SLOT field of the INDEX register to its number,
unless no entry was found, in which case the P field of the INDEX
register is set to -1. (This makes the value of the INDEX register
negative, which is easily tested.)
</ul>
The INDEX field of the RANDOM register ranges from 8 to 63; it is
incremented on every instruction executed, which is not very random
but apparently adequate for the purpose, which is to fill the TLB
rapidly and effectively. Entries 0 through 7 of the TLB are never
touched by <tt>TLBWR</tt> and can be used for reserved or special
mappings.
</p>

<p>
The processor is built to support a fast-path TLB refill handler,
which is invoked via the UTLB exception vector (see above). The idea
is that the OS maintains page tables in virtual memory using the kseg2
region (see above) and loads the base address of the page table into
the PTBASE field of the CONTEXT register. Each page table entry is a
4-byte quantity suitable for loading directly into the TLBLO register;
1024 of these fit on a 4K page, so each page table page maps 4MB and
it takes 512 pages, or 2MB of virtual space, to map the whole 2GB user
address space. (Since these are placed in virtual memory, only the
page table pages that are used need be materialized.) With this setup,
the UTLB exception handler can then read the CONTEXT register and use
the resulting value to load directly from the page table. If this
fails because that section of the page table is not materialized, a
second (non-UTLB) exception occurs. Careful register usage and the
three-deep nesting of the bottom part of the STATUS register allows
the general-purpose exception handler to recover from this condition
and proceed as desired. On success, the UTLB handler can then
unconditionally write the PTE it got into the TLB. If the V (valid)
bit is not set, on return from the UTLB handler another exception will
occur; however, because a matching (though not valid) TLB entry
exists, this will not be a UTLB exception, and the general exception
handler will get control and can schedule pagein or whatever.
</p>

<p>
There are a number of possible other ways to use the UTLB handler, of
course. One simple way is to just have it jump to the general-purpose
exception handler.
</p>

<p>
As noted above, the V (valid) bit does not prevent a TLB entry from
being "matching". A TLB entry is matching if both of the following are
true:
<ul>
<li> The VPAGE of the entry matches the virtual address being
     translated, and
<li> either the ASID of the entry matches the ASID currently loaded
     into the TLBHI register, or the entry has the G (global) flag
     set.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
One must never load the TLB in such a fashion that two (or more)
entries can match the same virtual address. If this happens, the
processor shuts down and is unrecoverable except by hard reset.
Since there is no way to prevent entries from matching, one should
clear the TLB by loading each entry with a distinct VPAGE, and use
VPAGEs from the kseg0 or kseg1 regions that will never be presented to
the MMU for translation. To reset the TLB at startup, since it is not
cleared by processor reset, one should use a second, potentially
larger, set of distinct VPAGEs and check that each is not already
present before loading it.
</p>

<p>
There is no way to tell if a TLB entry has been used, or how recently
it has been used. Nor is there a direct way to tell if a TLB entry has
been used for writing. The D ("dirty") bit can be used for this
purpose with software support, as follows:
<ul>
<li> When the TLB entry is first loaded, clear the D bit. This will
     make the MMU treat the translation as read-only.
<li> Upon a write, a MOD exception will occur. If writing through this
     translation is legal, set the D bit in the TLB and anywhere else
     in the virtual memory system data structures that might be
     desired. The page is now dirty, and the processor will write to
     it freely.
<li> When the page is written back or otherwise cleaned, or on a
     periodic basis to measure usage over time, flush the TLB entry or
     reload it with the D bit clear again.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The MMU exceptions are as follows:
<ul>
<li> MOD -- attempt to write through a TLB entry whose D bit is not
     set. Software should respond either by making the TLB entry
     writable or treating the condition as a failure.
<li> TLBL -- TLB miss (entry not present, or entry not valid) on a
     data read. If the address was in kuseg and the entry was not
     present, the UTLB handler is invoked. Otherwise the general
     exception handler is invoked. The failing address is placed in
     BADVADDR, and as noted above in the VSHIFT field of the CONTEXT
     register. The VPAGE field of the TLBHI register is also loaded.
     Software should respond by loading a matching and valid
     translation, or treating the condition as a failure.
<li> TLBS -- TLB miss on store. Otherwise the same as TLBL.
<li> ADEL -- address error on load. An address error is either an
     unaligned access or an attempt to access kernel memory while in
     user mode. Software should respond by treating the condition as a
     failure.
<li> ADES -- same as ADEL, but for stores.
</ul>

<h3><font face=tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans>Cache Control</font></h3>

<p>
The MIPS-I has a remarkably painful cache and cache control
architecture. While the MIPS-161 exhibits the same cache control bits
in the STATUS register, it is in fact cache-coherent and there is no
need to flush, examine, or otherwise touch the cache subsystem. In
fact, doing any of these things in the MIPS-I fashion will result in
undefined behavior.
</p>

<p>
Since normal MIPS processors have split instruction and data caches,
and future System/161 releases may include more cache handling, it is
recommended that all necessary flushes of the instruction cache be
included and stubbed out.
</p>

<h3><font face=tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans>Out-of-Order Execution</font></h3>

<p>
Even with cache coherence, or when using uncached memory regions,
processors that support out-of-execution may require so-called memory
barrier instructions to ensure that memory accesses occur on the
external bus (and become visible to other processors or devices) in
the same order they are issued in machine code.
</p>

<p>
The MIPS-II <tt>SYNC</tt> instruction can be used to wait until all
pending load and store operations are complete. This guarantees that
all memory updates before the <tt>SYNC</tt> become visible before any
memory updates after the <tt>SYNC</tt>. All <tt>SYNC</tt> instructions
executed on all cores and processors within a system occur in a single
well defined global order.
</p>

<p>
The MIPS-161 currently has no support for out-of-order execution and
the <tt>SYNC</tt> instruction is not supported. This may change in
the future.
</p>

<h3><font face=tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans>Cores</font></h3>

<p>
Each MIPS-161 processor has only one core on the die. However, as
noted <A HREF=system.html>elsewhere</A> System/161 supports up to 32
processors on the mainboard. There is little software-visible
difference between 32 single-core processors on one mainboard and 32
cores in one processor; most of what effects exist are cache-related
and not modeled by System/161 in any event.
</p>

<h3><font face=tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans>Startup</font></h3>

<p>
On CPU reset execution begins from the Reset vector defined above.
The processor starts out in an almost completely undefined state.
The cache is in an undefined state (except on the MIPS-161 this does
not matter...), the TLB is in an undefined state, and the contents of
the general and kernel-mode registers are all undefined, except as
follows:
<ul>
<li> The B (boot) flag of the STATUS register is set to 1, so
     exceptions will go to the boot exception vectors in kseg1 instead
     of the kernel exception vectors in kseg0.
<li> The KUc and IEc bits of the STATUS register are set to 0, so the
     processor is in kernel mode and interrupts are disabled.
</ul>
The code at the Reset vector must in general sort out the processor
state before it can do anything else.
</p>

<p>
In System/161, the boot ROM takes care of these issues and loads a
kernel as described in the <A HREF=lamebus.html>LAMEbus
documentation</A>. However, the state guaranteed by the boot ROM is
only slightly more flexible: the boot ROM guarantees that the cache is
in a workable state, and it provides a stack and an argument string in
the a0 register. The TLB is still in an undefined state and the
contents of other general and kernel-mode registers and register
fields are still undefined.
</p>

<h3><font face=tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans>Identifying the
Processor</font></h3>

<p>
Currently, code that knows it is running on System/161 may assume it
has a MIPS-161 and proceed accordingly.
</p>

<p>
Code that wants to run unchanged on a variety of MIPS platforms
without a System/161-specific startup wedge is likely to run into
problems: there is no safe way to identify that one is running on
System/161 as such, and distinguishing the MIPS-161 from an
arbitrarily chosen MIPS-I is likely to be problematic. The MIPS-161
sets the PRID register to 0x0000 beef; however, my understanding is
that the contents of the PRID register for early MIPS models (where
the upper 16 bits are defined as 0) cannot even be used reliably to
distinguish real deployed hardware. It might be possible to
distinguish the MIPS-161 based on its cache (non-)behavior; however,
